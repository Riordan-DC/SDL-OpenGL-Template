"I always forget how to do this..."

C SDL OpenGL Project Template :-)
Run make to build a platform specific blank SDL window with OpenGL functions.


Simply edit the Makefile, then write code in src/ and include/ to your hearts content!

OpenGL functions are loaded with Glad. If you require specific support or extensions simply replace the glad files! :-)
